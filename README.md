# Application Tracker

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e1c76b0-52a1-4739-9fa4-48fa5be2ec73

## Description

A web application to track job applications made by users in a card format. Users can create an account to keep record on each application, showing live statistics on the total amount of applications made and their current status.

### Motivation

Instead of keeping a csv file on all the applications made, I decided to create a full-stack web application to help my job search. Using different technologies and techniques to showcase my skills and improve my time spent on job applications.

### Features

- Table of cards representing each application made by a user
- Search capability on Company/Position
- Status filter

### Future Updates

- Daily Streaks/Counters
- GenerativeAI
- Job recommendation


## Quickstart WIP

1. Clone repository
  * `git clone [repo_url]` (if git CLI is intalled)
3. install dependencies from node_modules
  * `npm install` in a terminal within the project folder (if npm is installed already)
3. Run the dev command with npm
  * `npm run dev`

* Need to bypass login form and dashboard page API requests (May possibly add feature flags for dev mode)
